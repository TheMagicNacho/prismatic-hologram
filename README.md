# The Prismatic Hologram
A Role Playing Game



Regions hold multiple townships. Townships connect to structures. 
Region > townships > structure

Townships can connect to other townships. Regions do not connect to anything. They are containers of towns. Structures are held within townships, structures must connect to towns and can optionally connect to other structures (chaining dungeons together).

## Access Control
How do we manage access control to areas?

## Area State
How do we manage how areas change over time? How do user actions influance the areas around them?
